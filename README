The root level of the repository has files to configure and run the Portal.

A few bash scripts simplify host-specific build and deploy actions:

    build-image.sh         build a MAGC Portal-specific Docker image
    deploy-stack.sh        deploy or update one service stack based on a config file
    grep-build-error.sh    a build-image.sh helper for developers to locate installation errors
    run-node-command.sh    execute a single bash command on a single specific docker node
    show-swarm-status.sh   compact, informative report on the identifiers and states of swarm nodes
    update-app-servers.sh  run pull-code-repositories.sh in all running app-server containers

File 'tree.txt' provides a tree diagram of this repository's directories and files.

Folder 'stack' provides sub-folders, one per stack, with stack config files.
See those folders for details.
 
The helper scripts need the following host-specific files in '../config',
where '..' is the parent of the root of this repository (and thus not part
of this repository).

    server.sh                 sets environment variables needed by stack configs
    docker-registry-login.sh  script that logs in to a suitable docker registry
    globus_config.yml         completed file of the same name from 'magc-portal-apps'
